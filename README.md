MyPetPal is a C++ console application where you care for a virtual pet by feeding, playing, and letting it rest. The pet evolves over time, reacts to your actions, and can even perform tricks like sit and roll when happy.

Core Features:

Pet hunger, happiness, energy, health, and mood systems

Age progression and stage evolution (Baby → Teen → Adult)

Achievements like "Survived 10 Days" and "Perfect Care"

Pet sickness if neglected, with recovery via medicine

Fun trick commands: sit, roll

Save/load profiles with password protection

Day system with event triggers and mini-random events

Console feedback for actions (meals, sleep, medicine, etc.)

Built with beginner-friendly C++ concepts like functions, file handling, conditionals, and randomness—perfect for learning object-oriented logic in a fun and interactive way.
